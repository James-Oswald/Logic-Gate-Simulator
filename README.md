# Logic-Gate-Simulator
A Java application to simulate logic gate circuits. Developed in late 2016 to help me better understand computer architecture

## Background
I was very amazed when I found out about logic circuits and how they operated in 10th grade, It blew my mind to think you could
make things like binary adders and whole computers out of them. I knew right away that I had to make an application to simulate them,
and this small Java GUI project was the result. The final version came out very nice in my eyes, I was very happy with the ability for
me to drag gates around and chain them. Looking back there were quite a few flaws, the biggest of which being the inability
to feed outputs back to inputs without causing an infinite loop that would crash the program, and no good way to visualize the output of
a chain of gates without looking at the tip of the last gate.
